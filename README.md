# an experiment for a better bbg
this is a test to see if splitting into multiple crates would be beneficial for this project
splitting into multiple crates has benefits like:
- allowing business logic to be seperated from presentation logic for tests (this can also be done without making into multiple crates)
- making this bot be extremely modular
- allowing parts of the bot to be used in other projects that don't need to be a discord bot
- not sure what else lol

after migrations fully complete this branch will be renamed to master (yes the old codebase will still exist on another branch)
